## Project Summary
### The issue we are hoping to solve
Fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas – are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions. It is estimated that 37.12 billion metric tons of carbon emission are produced per year since 1940 and keep rising with the highest amount ever recorded in 2022. Our technology aims to improve the ability to measure, analyze, or take decisive action on carbon emissions and other harmful greenhouse gases like Methane, Nitrous Oxide and industrial gases. The technology will provide users with information about the amount of greenhouse gases produced around the world, their region and by themselves.
### How our technology solution can help
Informs users about their carbon footprint and the impact their daily action has on the environment
### Our idea
Climate change is an urgent global issue that demands immediate attention and action and one of the major contributors of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. While many efforts are underway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, measuring these emissions and providing them to users has not become widely possible. That is why I've created an app that provides data about carbon emissions and other harmful greenhouse gases and provide users with a better understanding of their impact in the environment. The app is meant to raise awareness and educate users about the impact their daily action have on the enviornment, how they can improve it and empower individuals to make more sustainable choices.<br>
The reason why most people are unaware about the impact carbon emission has on our environment is because information about it is not easily accessible to them
